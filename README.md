# Face-Mask-Detector
The purpose of implementing the Face Mask Detector application is to first detect different faces and then recognise the masks on different faces.
The two approaches that I followed to initiate this project is:
1) Detection technique to detect whether there is a face present or not.
2) Recognition technique to recognize whether the face wearing a mask or not.

This particular application is based on two phases: firstly, Training phase followed by Inference phase.
